This Ultimaker firmware is based on the RepRap FiveD firmware and will be updated with RepRap commits. As well, it will be maintained by Erik de Bruijn and Rob Gilson with an emphasis on supporting multiple Host software's. It should already work well with the Java host, but I've added ReplicatorG drivers, etc.

For a nice, compatible ReplicatorG version, see this github page:

Supported Platforms
====================

Please note that to better focus on current hardwares the Ultimaker firmware does not support RepRap Gen 3 or earlier electronics. The Ultimaker firmware is designed for the Ultimaker PCB and similar Arduino Mega-based hardware.

What we _do_ support:
 - We do support Arduino Mega Ultimaker hardware
 - We do support Arduino Mega RAMPS hardware

What we _don't_ support:
 - We do not support Gen 3 hardware.
 - We do not support Gen 2 hadware.
